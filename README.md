# NMDE2-proj1
Numerical Schemes for the Riemann Problem of 1-order scalar transport equation.
The objective of the project is to solve this problem with four different numerical schemes(Upwind, Lax-Friedrichs, Lax-Wendroff and Beam-Warming) , compare the numerical outcome with the exact solution respectively at time T=0.5 and analysis the numerical results .
